\section{Peripherals}
\label{sec:peripherals}
Comunication with peripherals is achieved through interruptions and four special porpouse registers: PWD, PRD, PWA, and PRA.

Whenever a peripheral should be written the sequence that must be followed is:
\begin{itemize}
 \item PWA must be set using \emph{movi2s} with the peripheral address.
 \item PWD must be set using \emph{movi2s} instruction to copy the information from one of the GPR's. Automatically,
       a strobe is generated on the \emph{pwd\_wr\_ena} output pin signaling the writting operation.
\end{itemize}

Whenever a peripheral should be read the sequence that must be followed is:
\begin{itemize}
 \item PRA must be set by external hardware.
 \item PRD must be set by external hardware.
 \item The \emph{irq} line is raised.
\end{itemize}
Since the system is synchronous with the CPU clock, the three events avobe can happen at the same time (i.e. in the
same clock cycle).
