\subsection{Introduction}
\label{ssec:introduction}
Welcome to the \xfire Processor Architecture! The \xfire (pronoiced ``Crossfire'') Processor Architechture is targeted
to be synthesized on FPGA and ASICs and its objective is to provide a solution for embedded systems. The processor is designed under the full RISC
philosophy and is mainly focused on providing a simple and implementation agnositc architecture.

This manual describes the architechture, the instruction set, the internal registers, the addressing modes, the supported data types, the memory model,
the peripheral interface, exceptions and interruptions. This manual does not describe neither implementation nor details such as pipeline,
cache and other optimizations, leaving those details to the implementation itself.
