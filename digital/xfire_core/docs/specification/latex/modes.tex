\section{Operating modes}
\label{sec:modes}
The processor has two different operating modes: \emph{supervisor mode}
and \emph{user mode}.

In supervisor mode, all instructions can be executed and the CFG[0]
register is unset.

In user mode, some instructions can not be executed. Any attempt to execute
one of those instructions causes an invalid operation exception (E2). The user
mode is indicated by setting CFG[0].

The privileged instructions (those that can only be executed in supervisor mode)
are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{movi2s}
\item \texttt{movs2i}
\item \texttt{rfe}
\end{itemize}

The reset mode is always supervisor mode.

The instruction \emph{trap} is used by user programs to generate software exceptions (providing a mechanism to implement system calls).

The \emph{rfe} returns the processor to user mode. Another way to return the processor
to user mode is by setting CFG[0].
